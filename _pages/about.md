My name is **Karthik Selvam**. I'm a Part time Trader and a Machine Learning Engineer. I have been trading in Indian stock market since fall of 2016.I started as an Options trader and gradually moved to swing trading and Investing. 

I trade financial markets using Price Action based supply and demand strategy. I consider myself to be self-taught having developed my trading approach through trial and error. This strategy is a unique interpretation of a blend of information which has been gained from exposure to many others throughout my trading journey.

I am fueled by my passion for understanding the nuances of Markets.I consider myself a forever student of Market eager to both build on my foundations in Machine Learning and Ecometrics.

My hunger for Knowledge and determination to turn Information into action has inspired to start **Mindfultrading**. Here at Mindfultrading, I will be sharing my knowlegde and experience as I explore world of Investing and Trading.I believe mindfulness in the work is key to success - a tenet I live out through my interests in martial arts, meditation, running, and playing guitar.
