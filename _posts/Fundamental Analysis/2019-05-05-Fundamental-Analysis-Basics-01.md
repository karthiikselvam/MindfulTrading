Learning Outcomes:

1.Define What accounting is ?

2.Types of Accounting ?

Accounting :

Accounting is the formal collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting of financial and non-financial data about a company to various end users.

### Type of Accounting :

#### 1.Financial Accounting:

Financial accounting communicates to outsiders through financial statements and additional disclosures, all of which are a part of the company's quarterly and annual reports. These reports are audited for accuracy and conformity with accounting rules.

#### 2.Managerial Accounting:

The primary purpose of managerial accounting is to provide information for decision making within the company. The information provided through managerial accounting helps determining product costs, profitability and pricing, determining product mix, introducing and discontinuing products, 
and capacity planning and determining production volumes. A secondary purpose is for performance evaluation and cost control. Unlike financial accounting reports, there is no fix formats for managerial accounting reports and they are not audited.

#### 3.Tax Accounting:

Tax accounting provides information to tax authorities. It is legal to prepare separate statements for tax and financial purposes as some of the rules used to prepare statements for tax purposes may defer from those use to form financial statements.

As a Trader/Investor we mainly Focus on Financial Accounting:
Financial Accounting is based on Accruals.
 
 *''Accounting method that records revenues and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. The term "accrual" refers to any individual entry recording revenue or expense in the absence of a cash transaction''*

Accrual Accounting occurs through the process of revenue recognition and matching costs to revenues. Revenue recognition means that a company can report revenue that is earned through delivery of service or product can measure this revenue and is reasonably sure of receiving this revenue. 
Matching costs to revenues means that expenses directly related to revenues are recognized in the same period as the revenues are recognized.

In a nutshell, accrual accounting says that we do not have to see the cash to record a transaction.

Some of the financial and non-financial reporting is mandated and that companies are required to release this periodically, typically quarterly.

In Next article, we will start looking at some of the common financial statements.
