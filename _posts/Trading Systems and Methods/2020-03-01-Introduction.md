Welcome to Applied course on Trading Systems and Methods,In this course i will discussing how to build a trading system from scratch and following are the primary goals of this course.

1)To share with you the way that I view the financial markets and the way that I use price action and supply and demand methodlogy to identify and manage trades.

2)To share with you the development process that one needs to follow in order to become a consistently profitable and professional trader, regardless of the strategy you choose to implement.

***Success in Stock Market comes through a process of learning to trust yourself as you operate within an environment of uncertainty. Trusting your ability to make effective decisions, to manage risk, and to identify and manage opportunity.***

I will be sharing the strategy that I use the strategy shared here is a discretionary method of trading. It is a Price action based supply and demand trading strategy, which involves analysis across three timeframes.However I can't guarantee that it will suit your needs and provide you with consistent profitability. In applying this strategy, you'll be required to use your own discretion and intuition. 

In upcoming series of articles i  will introduce you to the underlying theory of the markets and a strategy which is designed to operate within that market reality.Take what works for you, and discard what doesn't blending my approach with your previous knowledge and experience to create your own work of art.

Few things i want to make it clear, I consider myself to be self-taught,
having developed my trading approach through trial and error.That being said, I see there is nothing new in my approach to trading that hasn't been discovered before by others. This is just my unique interpretation of a blend of information which has been gained from exposure to many others throughout my trading journey.
